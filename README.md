# Search Engine Spam Blocker extension for Firefox

SESB allows you to filter out sites from your search engines results using our built-in curated list of spam sites (which you can find [here](https://github.com/no-cmyk/Search-Engine-Spam-Blocklist)) and/or your own blocklist, to which you can freely add and remove sites you don't wanna see in your search engine results.

SESB currently supports results pages on Google, DuckDuckGo, Bing, Yahoo! Search, Startpage and Yandex.
